## üèÜ GenAI Exchange Hackathon Project

This project was developed for the GenAI Exchange Hackathon, showcasing advanced AI integration with modern web development practices.

**Note:** This project has been uniquely built leveraging Generative AI tools (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and OpenAI APIs). While core code generation was AI-assisted, the real challenge‚Äîprompt engineering, code restructuring, debugging, integration, feature management, and deployment‚Äîwas entirely done by me. This demonstrates how AI can accelerate development, but the vision, problem-solving, and execution behind the project are 100% human-driven.
