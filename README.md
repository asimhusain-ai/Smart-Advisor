# Smart Career Advisor - AI-Powered Career Path Recommendation System
Note: This project has been uniquely built leveraging Generative AI tools (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and OpenAI APIs). While the core code generation was AI-assisted, the real challenge‚Äîprompt engineering, code restructuring, debugging, integration, feature management, and deployment‚Äîwas entirely done by me.
The approach demonstrates how AI can accelerate development, but the vision, problem-solving, and execution behind the project are 100% human-driven. Made With ‚ù§Ô∏è  https://asimhusain.vercel.app
